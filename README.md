# 3D U-Net for Volumetric Segmentation

A 3D U-Net implementation for volumetric data segmentation using deep learning, with patch-based training for handling large 3D volumes.

## Overview

This project implements a 3D U-Net architecture for segmentation of volumetric data, particularly useful for:
-> Medical image segmentation (CT/MRI scans)
-> Geological sample analysis
-> Any 3D volumetric data segmentation tasks
